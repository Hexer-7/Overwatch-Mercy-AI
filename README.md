#### Description:
The Mercy AI is a smart assistant designed for Overwatch 2, enabling automatic Pocket healing for allies with AI (not hack). It's particularly useful in tight situations. 

- The bot monitors teammates' health in-game and assists Mercy in healing by pressing the heal button automatically.
- When healing is complete or nearly complete, the bot prompts Mercy to switch to a damage boost mode.

Think of it as having a reliable digital companion that efficiently manages these actions, allowing the player to focus on the game. Simply turn on the bot, and it takes care of everything, making it especially handy during intense gameplay and challenging victories!

#### Release:
For the latest release and downloadable files, visit the [Download release](https://github.com/hexer-7/overwatch-mercy-ai/releases).

#### Important:
If you have trouble with Mercy AI (not working correctly in-game), try setting the game to fullscreen (not borderless) and then restart the game.

#### Purpose:
The idea behind the bot may seem peculiar, but it's simply a concept that I thought of and wanted to implement. The bot is virus-free for those who enjoy embodying the character of Detective Conan.

#### Features:
- Automatically adjusts Mercy's actions based on ally health status.
- Switches to damage boost when an ally is affected by Ana's grenade.
- Increases healing or damage boost as needed.
- Ensures virus-free operation.
- Customizable settings for screen resolution and Mercy's health bar color.
- Allows users to pause Mercy AI with F2.

#### Requirements:
- Supported screen resolutions: 4K (2160), 2K (1440), FHD (1080), HD+ (768).
- Mercy's health bar color must be consistent (avoid using multiple colors for different functions).

  **Avoid using yellow or blue for the health bar color to prevent potential issues with the bot.**

- You have to choose other buttons for heal and damage boost in-game and set them in Mercy AI. For example:

- Hold the left click and Mercy AI will take care of your allies :)

**Note:** I highly recommend using the white color, as other colors are not stable.

#### Notes:
- Mercy AI size is relatively large (~75 MB), but the benefits are worth it.
- Users must provide feedback and report any issues encountered during usage.
