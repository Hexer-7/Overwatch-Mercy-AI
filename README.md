### Overwatch Mercy AI

#### Description:
Overwatch Mercy AI is a smart helper known as "Mercy AI" designed for a game.

It's particularly useful in tight situations. 

The bot keeps a close watch on the health of teammates being healed by the in-game character "Mercy." 

If a teammate's health is low, the program automatically assists Mercy in healing by pressing heal button. 

Once the healing is complete or near completion, the bot prompts Mercy to switch to a mode that automatically boosts damage.

Think of it as having a reliable digital companion that efficiently manages these actions, allowing the player to focus on the game. 

Simply turn on the bot, and it takes care of everything, making it especially handy during intense gameplay and challenging victories!

If you have trouble with a Mercy AI (not working correctly in game), try setting the game to fullscreen (not borderless) and then restart the game.

The idea behind the bot may seem peculiar, but it's simply a concept that I thought of and wanted to implement. The bot is virus-free for those who enjoy embodying the character of Detective Conan.

- use white color only for health bar*.

- You have to choose another buttons for heal and damage boost in game and type it on Mercy AI, For example:

-Then you just have to hold left click and Mercy AI will take care of your ally's :)
