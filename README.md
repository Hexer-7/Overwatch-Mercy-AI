### Overwatch Mercy AI

#### Description:
Overwatch Mercy AI is a smart helper known as "Mercy AI" designed for a game.

It's particularly useful in tight situations. 

The bot keeps a close watch on the health of teammates being healed by the in-game character "Mercy." 

If a teammate's health is low, the program automatically assists Mercy in healing by mimicking a mouse click. 

Once the healing is complete or near completion, the bot prompts Mercy to switch to a mode that automatically boosts damage.

Think of it as having a reliable digital companion that efficiently manages these actions, allowing the player to focus on the game. 

Simply turn on the bot, and it takes care of everything, making it especially handy during intense gameplay and challenging victories!

If you have trouble with a Mercy AI (not working correctly in game), try setting the game to fullscreen (not borderless) and then restart the game.

The idea behind the bot may seem peculiar, but it's simply a concept that I thought of and wanted to implement. The bot is virus-free for those who enjoy embodying the character of Conan.

- Automatically adjusts Mercy's actions based on ally health status.
- Increases healing or damage boost as needed.
- Ensures virus-free operation.
- Customizable settings for screen resolution and Mercy's health bar color.
- Allows users to define hotkeys for activating and pausing the bot.

#### Requirements:
- Supported screen resolutions: 4K (2160), 2K (1440), FHD (1080), HD+ (768).
- Mercy's health bar color must be consistent (avoid using multiple colors for different functions).

- Avoid using yellow or blue for the health bar color to prevent potential issues with the bot.


#### Notes:
- The bot's file size is relatively large (~100 MB), but the benefits are worth it.
- Users must provide feedback and report any issues encountered during usage.
